# Earth Invaders
Inspired by the classic *Space Invaders*, except this time, Earth is the enemy. With modern mechanics, your mission is to destroy incoming human spaceships, dodge bullets, and unleash your ultimate ability to wipe out everything in your path.

Fast reflexes and smart timing are your best weapons. **Good luck, defender!**

## How to Play
* If an enemy bullet hits you, you **lose** a life.
* If an enemy reaches the bottom of the screen, you **lose** a life.
* You have **3 lives**. Lose all of them, and it's **game over**.
* Defeating an enemy increases your score by 1.
* Difficulty increases as you survive, up to a max at score 100.
